# Java Encryption and Decryption Program

## Description:<br>
This Java program provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom encryption algorithm. It features an intuitive graphical interface where users can generate encryption keys, input text, encrypt and decrypt messages, and exit the application. The program employs Swing, a Java GUI framework, to create a seamless user experience.<br>

## Key Features:<br>
**Intuitive Graphical Interface:** The program offers a visually appealing interface with text input and output areas, buttons for key generation, encryption, decryption, and quitting.<br>
**Dynamic Key Generation:** Users can generate new encryption keys, ensuring the security of their encrypted messages.<br>
**Efficient Encryption and Decryption:** The program utilizes a custom encryption algorithm to securely encrypt and decrypt text.<br>
**Responsive Controls:** Button actions are responsive and provide real-time feedback to users.<br>
**Thorough Testing:** The program is rigorously tested to ensure reliability and accuracy in encryption and decryption processes.<br>

## How It Works:<br>
**Generate Key:** Click the "Generate Key" button to create a new encryption key.<br>
**Input Text:** Enter the text you want to encrypt into the input text area.<br>
**Encrypt Text:** Click the "Encrypt Text" button to encrypt the entered text using the generated key.<br>
**Decrypt Text:** Click the "Decrypt Text" button to decrypt the encrypted text back to its original form.<br>
**Exit Application:** Click the "Quit" button to exit the application.<br>
