# Java Encryption and Decryption Program
This Java program provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom encryption algorithm. It features an intuitive graphical interface where users can generate encryption keys, input text, encrypt and decrypt messages, and exit the application. The program employs Swing, a Java GUI framework, to create a seamless user experience.

## Key Features:
- **Intuitive Graphical Interface:** The program offers a visually appealing interface with text input and output areas, buttons for key generation, encryption, decryption, and quitting.
- **Dynamic Key Generation:** Users can generate new encryption keys, ensuring the security of their encrypted messages.
- **Efficient Encryption and Decryption:** The program utilizes a custom encryption algorithm to securely encrypt and decrypt text.
- **Responsive Controls:** Button actions are responsive and provide real-time feedback to users.
- **Thorough Testing:** The program is rigorously tested to ensure reliability and accuracy in encryption and decryption processes.

## Usage:
- **Generate Key:** Click the "Generate Key" button to create a new encryption key.
- **Input Text:** Enter the text you want to encrypt into the input text area.
- **Encrypt Text:** Click the "Encrypt Text" button to encrypt the entered text using the generated key.
- **Decrypt Text:** Click the "Decrypt Text" button to decrypt the encrypted text back to its original form.
- **Exit Application:** Click the "Quit" button to exit the application.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application, providing the foundational logic and structure for the encryption program.
- **Swing API (Java GUI):** Swing is utilized for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, text areas, labels, and panels, enabling the development of a user-friendly desktop application.
- **JUnit:** The JUnit testing framework is employed for writing and executing unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's functionalities and components.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Eclipse 

## Tests:
The Java Encryption Program includes unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of its functionalities. The tests are written using the JUnit testing framework and cover key aspects of the program, including GUI rendering and functionality.
